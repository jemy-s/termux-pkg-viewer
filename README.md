# termux-pkg-viewer

Don't know termux yet? See [here](https://termux.com/) and [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) and [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages)

I wrote this tool to make it more convenient for myself to play termux. I used nodejs and [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) to develop this tool. The following is a screenshot. Welcome to use this tool, and if you have a better idea, just open a new issueðŸ˜€.
